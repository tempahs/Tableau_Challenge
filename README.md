# Unit 18 Homework: Citi Bike Analytics - New Jersey

The purpose of this challenge is to build a set of data visualization to provide answers to city officials' questions about the Citi Bike program in a way that is focused. The Tableau data story answers questions about New Jersey usage. Bike riding is an individual activity that prevents riders from proximity. Keeping this advantage in mind, the Citi Bike has an upper hand in the transportation industry and the ride volume grew over the years. Therefore, the time between January of 2020 to December of 2020 will be of main focus for my analysis with answers to the following questions:
•	Volume of subscriber vs costumer
•	Gender and age comparison 
•	Top 10 ending stations and start stions map
•	Growth user types over the time
•	Compression between distance and time by group of age
